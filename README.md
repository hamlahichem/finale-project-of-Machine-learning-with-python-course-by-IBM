# finale-project-of-Machine-learning-with-python-course-by-IBM
this repository is my finale project of Machine learning with python by IBM Course in Coursera. for more about this course click here https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-with-python.
So,in this project I implement the KNN, Decision tree ,Logitic regression, and Support vector machine algorithme for classifie the Loan dataset given by the instructor of the course who also give us in the notebook the preprocessing of data because the purpose of this course is not the preprocessing of data
the instructor of this course give us this notebook which contains preprocessing of data and he demand to implement the fourth algorithms of classification and the evaluation of the models
